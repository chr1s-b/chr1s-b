### Hi there 👋

#### I'm an MSci Mathematics undergrad at Imperial College London.

- ⚙️ I often use `.py`, `.js`, `.cs` but sometimes I work with `.r`, `.cpp`, `.jl` and more.
- 🌐 I'm most interested in tackling problems in security, infrastructure, and markets.
- :computer: Currently entering my final year, graduating June 2025.
