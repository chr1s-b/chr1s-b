### Hi there 👋

#### I'm a mathematics undergrad at Imperial College London.

- ⚙️ I mainly use `.py`, `.js` but sometimes I work with `.c`, `.cpp`, `.cs`
- :bullettrain_front: I'm interested in network security and the computer systems behind large infrastructure
- :computer: Currently seeking an internship position in tech or finance
