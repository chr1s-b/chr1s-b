### Hi there 👋

#### I'm a mathematics undergrad at Imperial College London.

- ⚙️ I mainly use `.py`, `.js` but sometimes I work with `.c`, `.cpp`, `.cs`
- :bullettrain_front: I'm interested in network security and the computer systems behind large infrastructure
- 🌍 I like learning new skills, especially [languages](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/Chr1sB)
- :computer: Let me know if you have an open internship position in the UK!
