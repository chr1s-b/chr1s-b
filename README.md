### Hi there 👋

#### I'm an MSci Mathematics undergrad at Imperial College London.

- ⚙️ I often use `.py`, `.js`, `.cs` but sometimes I work with `.r`, `.cpp`, `.jl` and more.
- 🌐 I'm most interested in tackling problems in infrastructure, markets, and network security.
- :computer: Currently seeking an internship position for Summer 2024.
